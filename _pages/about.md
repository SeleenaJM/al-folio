=Brief Intro

I'm a PhD student in Illinois Informatics Institute at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working with [J. Stephen Downie](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/j-stephen-downie). Before coming to UIUC, I obtained my M.S. degree in Information Sciences from University of Pittsburgh.


I'm interested in natural langauage processing and social computing. My research goal is to better analyze how humans and AI systems understand the information from digital materials such as films, images and ebooks.
