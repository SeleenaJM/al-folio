Short Intro
==

I'm currently a PhD student in Illinois Informatics Institute at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working with [J. Stephen Downie](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/j-stephen-downie) on research projects supported by [HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC)](https://analytics.hathitrust.org). Before coming to UIUC, I obtained my M.S. degree in Information Sciences from University of Pittsburgh. 

Previously, I've interned at [Deep Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group/) in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) working on the evaluation of image caption generators.

I'm interested in natural langauage processing and data analytics. My research goal is to better understand how humans and AI systems perceive the information from digital objects such as ebooks, images and films.
