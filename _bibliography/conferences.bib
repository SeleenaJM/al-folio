  abstract = {"With the success and popularity of vehicle navigation services, the demand for Pedestrian Navigation Services (PNS) has increased in recent years. PNS, while overlap in functionality with vehicle navigation services, must be designed specifically for the wayfinding and navigational needs and preferences of pedestrians. One major shortcoming of most existing PNS in outdoors is that they utilize and provide services based on road networks, resulting in PNS that do not effectively and properly track pedestrians as they usually walk on sidewalks, which have more segments and are narrower than roads. Challenges in building PNS include constructing appropriate sidewalk networks, continually tracking users in real time on sidewalks without interruption, and providing personalized routes as well as directions. In this paper, these challenges are highlighted and current trends in PNS, for both outdoors and indoors, are discussed and analyzed. A prototype PNS designed for the University of Pittsburg’s main campus sidewalk network (PNS-Pitt) is also discussed."},

  abstract = "This paper investigates the limitations and challenges of the curated datasets provided by digital libraries in support of digital humanities (DH) research. Our presented work provides a use case utilizing an English literature dataset of 178,381 volumes curated by the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) for measuring the change of three literature genres. These volumes were selected from over 17 million digitized items in the HathiTrust Digital Library. We demonstrate our methods and workflow for improving the representativeness and scholarly usability of the existing datasets. We analyzed and effectively overcame three common limitations: duplicate volumes, uneven distribution of data and OCR errors. We suggest that stakeholders of digital libraries should flag and address these limitations to improve their provisions' usability in the context of digital humanities research."

Popular metrics, such as BLEU and CIDEr, are based solely on text matching between reference captions and machine-generated captions, potentially leading to biased evaluations because references may not fully cover the image content and natural language is inherently ambiguous. Building upon a machine-learned text-image grounding model, TIGEr allows to evaluate caption quality not only based on how well a caption represents image content, but also on how well machine-generated captions match human-generated captions. Our empirical tests show that TIGEr has a higher consistency with human judgments than alternative existing metrics. We also comprehensively assess the metric{'}s effectiveness in caption evaluation by measuring the correlation between human judgments and metric scores.",

This score is often not informative enough to indicate what specific errors are made by a given system. In this study, we present a fine-grained evaluation method REO for automatically measuring the performance of image captioning systems. REO assesses the quality of captions from three perspectives: 1) Relevance to the ground truth, 2) Extraness of the content that is irrelevant to the ground truth, and 3) Omission of the elements in the images and human references. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a higher consistency with human judgments and provides more intuitive evaluation results than alternative metrics.",

A variety of standard lexical and syntactic features was used for this supervised learning task. Our results suggest that experts write comparatively lengthier and more detailed reviews that feature more complex grammar and a higher diversity in their vocabulary. Layman reviews are more subjective and contextualized in peoples{'} everyday lives. Our error analysis shows that laymen are about twice as likely to be mistaken as experts than vice versa. We argue that the type of author might be a useful new feature for improving the accuracy of predicting the rating, helpfulness and authenticity of reviews. Finally, the outcomes of this work might help researchers and practitioners in the field of impact assessment to gain a more fine-grained understanding of the perception of different types of media consumers and reviewers of a topic, genre or information product.",

  abstract="User-authored reviews offer a window into micro-level engagement with issue-focused documentary films, which is a critical yet insufficiently understood topic in media impact assessment. Based on our data, features, and supervised learning method, we find that ratings of non-documentary (feature film) reviews can be predicted with higher accuracy (73.67%, F1 score) than ratings of documentary reviews (68.05%). We also constructed a classifier that separates reviews of documentaries from reviews of feature films with an accuracy of 71.32%. However, as our goal with this paper is not to improve the accuracy of predicting the rating and type or genre of film reviews, but to advance our understanding of the perception of documentaries in comparison to feature films, we also identified commonalities and differences between these two types of films as well as between low versus high ratings. We find that in contrast to reviews of feature films, comments on documentaries are shorter but composed of longer sentences, are less emotional, contain less positive and more negative terms, are lexically more concise, and are more focused on verbs than on nouns and adjectives. Compared to low-rated reviews, comments with a high rating are shorter, are more emotional and contain more positive than negative sentiment, and have less question marks and more exclamation points. Overall, this work contributes to advancing our understanding of the impact of different types of information products on individual information consumers.",

  abstract="The comprehensive measurement of the impact that information products have on individuals, groups and society is of practical relevance to many actors, including philanthropic funding organizations. In this paper we focus on assessing one dimension of impact, namely public awareness, which we conceptualize as the amount and substance of attention that information products gain from the press and social media. We are looking at a type of products that philanthropic organizations fund, namely social justice documentaries. Using topic modeling as a text summarization technique, we find that films from certain domains, such as “Politics and Government” and “Environment and Nature,” attract more attention than productions on others, such as “Gender and Ethnicity”. We also observe that film-related public discourse on social media (Facebook and non-expert reviews) has a higher overlap with the content of a film than press coverage of films does. This is partially due to the fact that social media users focus more on the topics of a production whereas the press pays strong attention to cinematographic and related features.",

  abstract="With the rapid development of Internet technology, information resources on the Internet become more abundant, but also bring some problems like diversity, heterogeneity, disorder, and redundancy. Given a brief expression like search keywords only, users' needs are ambiguous. Therefore, current technologies of search applications relying on direct keyword matching cannot meet the requirements of users exactly. Service applications are hoped to be more intelligent and knowledgeable. To solve such challenge, this paper attempts to organize web pages into a semantic association graph based on a novel model - indexing network, which can provide more valuable information and services for users. An information search and recommendation services platform is implemented using cloud distributed systems (Hadoop + Habse + Zookeeper) based on Sugon-Tongji cloud platform that is located at Tongji University. 70 million web pages are crawled on the Internet and their corresponding indexing network model are constructed. Several novel services are implemented and provided on the platform, such as search location, search navigation, category/keyword recommendation, and the interaction interface of the indexing network. System demonstration and experimental analysis show that the proposed platform can provide and support more knowledgeable and valuable information search-related services, thereby better meeting the growing needs of Internet users.",
